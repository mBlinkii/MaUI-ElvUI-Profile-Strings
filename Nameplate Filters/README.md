# ElvUI - Filters for M+ players

### Updates

- 26.09.2025 - TWW S3 & ElvUI 14.0 Support


###

These filters are intended for Mythic Plus players and are active across all dungeon difficulty levels in the current season.

###

# HowTo

1. Important: Before importing these filters, please delete all old versions. Any filters starting with mMT- or m- are outdated and should no longer be used.
2. Copy the desired filter and easily import it into ElvUI under Profile > Import.
3. Activate the filters if you're not using one of my profiles or if you're using an outdated one.
